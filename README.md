## üöÄ Features

### üß† Advanced Extraction Modes
*Fully compatible with Bugcrowd and HackerOne scope pages.*

- **All Domains**: Extracts every potential domain from the page, including wildcards and exact domains.
- **Wildcards Only**: Isolates and lists only wildcard domains (e.g., `*.example.com`).
- **Exact Domains**: Extracts only specific, non-wildcard domains (e.g., `www.example.com`).
- **Clean Wildcards**: Extracts wildcard domains and removes the `*.` prefix, leaving a clean list of root domains.

### ‚ú® Smart Filtering & Validation
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Intelligently filters out common false positives like CDN placeholders, irrelevant text, and code snippets.
- **Domain Validation**: Ensures that extracted strings are valid, well-formed domains before they are added to the list.

### üíº Streamlined Workflow
- **Instant Preview**: See the extracted domains in the extension popup before downloading.
- **Live Counts**: Get immediate counts for each category (All, Wildcards, Exact, Cleaned).
- **One-Click Export**: Download your domain list as a clean `.txt` file, automatically named with the platform and timestamp.
- **Audio Feedback**: Unique sound cues confirm your actions for a seamless experience.
- **Platform Integration**: Works flawlessly on both Bugcrowd and HackerOne program pages.
